# ðŸ‘‹ Hi There!
ðŸ˜„ I'm Jay Fukumoto, a third year student at the **University of California, Irvine** (UCI) pursuing my bachelors in **Computer Science**. I aspire to become a **Software Engineer** and am currently seeking relevant internships for the summer of 2022.

ðŸ’¼ I currenly work for **theCoderSchool Irvine** as a code coach where I teach children and teens how to code in languages such as **Scratch** and **Python**. I also develop programs for the students to recreate step-by-step in order to get practice with fundamental coding topics.

ðŸ“– I enjoy learning new things and take every opportunity to grow as both a person and as a coder.

âš¡ Outside of coding, I enjoy playing Puzzle & Dragons and Super Smash Bros!

ðŸ“« You can reach me through direct messages on github or connect with me through [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jay-fukumoto/)!
